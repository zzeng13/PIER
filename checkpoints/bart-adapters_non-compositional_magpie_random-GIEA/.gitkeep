Implementation for Potentially Idiomatic Expression Representation (PIER) model


## Description

This repo contains the implementation for the Potentially Idiomatic Expression Representation (PIER) model from the paper: Unified Representation for Non-compositional and Compositional Expressions.

The paper is published in EMNLP2023 Findings. Please refer to the paper for more details.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

We recommend running the model training and evaluation in a Python virtual environment.
The dependencies and required packages are listed in `requirements.txt`.

Note that though our work utilized [AdapterHub](https://github.com/adapter-hub)'s adapter implementation.   We maintain a local copy of the AdapterHub source code in which we additionally implemented the `Fusion` module.  Hence, AdapterHub is not part of the requirements.

### Data
To run the model training and evaluation, supporting data (e.g., feature maps, training data, etc.) must be downloaded and place to the proper locations.

Please download data and put them into the following two directories:
* `./data`: Download and extract data from [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1tUwo5aL4o3ioJzppwcpMphYAzOnBnwfm/view?usp=sharing).
* `./fusion_analysis`: Download and extract data from [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1PCkCHi6lBIid6rW5bLnRijZyp2yixPac/view?usp=sharing).

### Model Checkpoints
PIER model utilizes pretrained [GIEA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.03679) model checkpoint as part of its architecture. So, before training the PIER model, you need to download the GIEA's checkpoints.
* GIEA model checkpoints: download [link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ZkKzQCnFCsdAN438l4worfK4kuSAJeoK/view?usp=sharing)
* Extract the checkpoint and place it under the direction: `./checkpoints/bart-adapters_non-compositional_magpie_random-GIEA`

We also provide our the checkpoints of best-performing model from the paper, PIER+. Download the trained checkpoint and you can perform IE embedding and PIER+ intrinsic evaluation directly without having to train the model yourself.
